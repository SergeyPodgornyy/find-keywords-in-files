Tx5SEEE TLS TR Development of a Requirement - Model synchronization tool
Mission et activités :
The intern will contribute to the development of a research software for linking requirements and
models in the context of Model Based System Engineering (MBSE). The internship will occur at the
beginning of a three years collaborative project called ModelWriter where text-model synchronization
capabilities will be developed for various tierce editors. The tool will be based on the existing Eclipse
open source Intent project, which is conceived for linking pieces of documents with technical artefacts
(pieces of code, models...).
More specifically, the intern will contribute to:
-                                                                                                           analyze needs for a use case that concerns the linking of a set of design requirement
documents and a rule database
-                                                                                                           Install and update the current environment with use case data
-                                                                                                           enhance code capability to treat the link between an editor and a rule database
Computer science (Master 2). Java development skills; experience with SWT and Eclipse framework
technologies (JDT, CDT, PDE, etc.) and in object-oriented development and design. Background in
user interface technologies and design. Interest in knowledge management is a plus.
