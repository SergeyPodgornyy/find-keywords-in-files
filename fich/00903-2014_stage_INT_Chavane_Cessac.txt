Titre du stage: Decoding cortical activity evoked by artificial retinal implants
Durée:6 mois
Dates envisagées: 01-03-14 au 31-08-14
Descriptif (15 lignes max):   Recent advances in research opens up the possibility of
partially restoring vision to blind patients using retinal prostheses. However, the way
an  electric  stimulation  activates  the  visual  cortex  is  still  poorly  understood.  The
inViBE team has shown that a local electric stimulation of the retina evokes a cortical
activity up to 10 times larger than what is expected based on the activity evoked by
visual stimuli. This observed spread of evoked cortical activity is presumably due to 4
effects: (i) an electric diffusion at the interface made by the complex electrode-retinal
tissue; (ii) a spread of electric activity induced by the direct activation of retinal cells
axons away from their somata; (iii) an electric diffusion in the visual cortex; (iv) the
optical diffusion of the signal registered by optical imaging. The goal of the internship
is to analyse the data already obtained at Invibe team in order to quantify these
effects and especially to analyse the role played by the retina's network in the spread
of activity. The first step of the internship will to construct a model of the diffusion
induced by (i), (iii), (iv) and to compare the expected results with experiments. A next
step will then be to propose a neuronal network model characterizing the effect (ii).
Compétences  requises:   Strong  background  in  programming  and  skills  in
mathematics or physics. Great interest in the field of visual neuroscience, both for
fundamental aspects of visual processing and clinical research.
Responsable du stage:    frederic.chavane@univ-amu.fr (INT, CNRS, Marseille),
bruno.cessac@inria.fr (Neuromathcomp, INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis).
Contexte: The team inViBE at the Institut des Neurosciences de la Timone (INT-
CNRS) combines multiple expertises involving behavioral studies in both humans
and monkeys, ophthalmologic clinical approaches, electrophysiological and real-time
optical imaging studies in behaving monkeys and Bayesian modeling approaches.
The team Neuromathcomp at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis focuses on the exploration of
the brain from the mathematical and computational perspectives.
Gratification : ce stage donnera lieu à une gratification au niveau du standard légal.
