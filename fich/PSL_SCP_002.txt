PSL_SCP_002: Control Flow Graph based attacks
Summary of the internship
Modern  reverse-engineering  techniques  allow  attackers  to  understand  underlying  algorithms
structure of the software.   A common method consists in studying its control flow graph (CFG) that
statically shows all possible paths of executed instructions.  To counter this kind of attack, encryption
protection is not always possible and often not sufficient, so there is a need to evaluate alternative
solutions.   A known technique to make reverse engineering more complex consists in flattening its
Control Flow Graph*.    The goal of the internship is to analyse some implementations of this
technique.

Context
Modern reverse-engineering techniques allow attackers to understand underlying algorithms
structure of the software.   A common method consists in studying its control flow graph
(CFG) that statically shows all possible paths of executed instructions.  To counter this kind of
attack, encryption protection is not always possible and often not sufficient, so we need to
evaluate alternative solutions.    A known technique to make reverse engineering more
complex consists in flattening its Control Flow Graph*.
The efficiency of the CFG flattening is very dependent on its implementation.   Technicolor
would like to study different implementations and needs some new reversing tools to
evaluate them.

Objective
The goal of this internship is to design and develop some tools to reverse binaries protected
with CFG flattening.   This should allow us to evaluate and improve some CFG flattening
implementation.
Task description
The student will study the state of the art in CFG flattening and in reversing techniques.
Following this study, he will design innovating methods and tools for attacking protected
binaries. These tools should reconstruct a readable CFG and evaluate its level of protection
using information collected during the execution of the application.
