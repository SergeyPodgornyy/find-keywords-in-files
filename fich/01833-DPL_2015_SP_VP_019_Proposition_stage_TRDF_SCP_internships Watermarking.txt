Title of internship (web): DPL_2015_SP_VP_019 Signal Processing for Multimedia Security
Summary of the internship (web)
Piracy has been significantly facilitated by the commercial  deployment of software to manipulate digital multimedia
content, and the development of rapid and efficient distribution networks. To tackle this issue, content protection is mainly
ensured by cryptography during the distribution, but at the rendering time only forensics techniques can prevent from
piracy. Such forensics solutions mostly rely on (i) digital watermarking to
provide a tracing mechanism to be able to pinpoint the source of a leak
when  it  occurs,  and  (ii)  passive  forensics  techniques  to  characterize
pirate samples. Depending on the profile of the applicant, the internship
will  focus  either  on  research  or  development.  Technicolor  topics  of
interest in video forensics include  (but are not limited to): assessing
HEVC  watermarking  system,  improving  HTTP  Adaptive  Streaming
contents watermarking, refining fidelity models to ensure invisibility of
the  watermarks  on  either  single  or  stereo  contents,  proposing  new
features for video re-alignment in the particular case of short sequences,
defining the piracy path and some passive video forensics statistics of the screencasting attack.

Title of internship: Signal Processing for Multimedia Security
Internship period & duration: 6 months e.g. March-August 2015 (can be adjusted)
Working environment: The selected candidate will join a team of 6 researchers and engineers working on signal processing for
multimedia security. The members of the team are located in Rennes (France) in the new facilities of Technicolor R&D France, the largest
Research Centre of the group.
Context: The rapid transition from analog to digital media over the last decades puts the Entertainment industry under increased
pressure to protect their high-valued assets. Piracy has indeed been significantly facilitated with the commercial deployment of software
to manipulate digital content, and the development of rapid and efficient distribution networks. To tackle this issue, content protection is
mainly ensured by cryptography during the distribution, but at the rendering time only forensics techniques can prevent from piracy.
Such forensics solutions mostly rely on (i) digital watermarking to provide a tracing mechanism to be able to pinpoint the source of a leak
when it occurs, and (ii) passive forensics techniques to characterize pirate samples.
Objective: The intern will contribute to Technicolor’s effort to propose innovative solutions in video forensics. Depending on the profile
of the applicant, the internship will focus either on research or development. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
