Title of internship:
Implementation and evaluation of different authentication techniques
Summary of the internship:
In today’s digital world, authentication is needed everywhere. The
goal of the internship is to test and to validate different
authentication techniques defined by Technicolor researchers. This
validation will be done by comparing these techniques with existing
ones, in the user point of view to determine whether they provide
advantages in terms of usability. The student will first have to
familiarize with these authentication techniques to be able to
determine a framework to experiment, test and analyse the results.
This work may lead to new techniques that would be more user-
oriented. The trainee will determine the best framework for the
implementation of this study (PC, Web, Tablet ...).
Detailed description:
Context
During various projects, some researchers in Technicolor have studied, defined and patented
a set of innovative authentication techniques in the field of graphical passwords, textual
passwords and help to password entry. These techniques were never put into perspective
because of lack of time.
Objective
The goal is threefold, firstly, these techniques need to be implemented. Secondly a user
evaluation framework needs to be defined. Finally, user test have to be performed to
evaluate these techniques, compare them to more traditional techniques and validate them
if the results are positive.
Task description
The trainee should study the various techniques that we have defined and the existing ones
and define a user evaluation plan. He will then make the necessary development, implement
and perform user testing before analysing all the results. These results may lead to new ideas
for authentication techniques.
